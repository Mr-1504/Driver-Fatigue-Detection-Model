# Driver Fatigue Detection Model

## 📝 Overview
The **Driver Fatigue Detection Model** is an AI-powered system designed to detect driver fatigue through real-time facial feature analysis. By monitoring signs such as eye movement and yawning, the model aims to reduce road accidents caused by driver exhaustion.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Dataset:** Images of drivers annotated with fatigue levels based on key facial attributes.
- **Model:** Deep learning (CNN-based) models to classify and detect fatigue signs.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Integrated camera support for live monitoring and alerts.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model accuracy and responsiveness under real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Key Features
1. Real-time facial analysis for fatigue detection.
2. Automated alerts to warn drivers.
3. Adjustable sensitivity thresholds for fatigue detection.
4. User-friendly interface.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.7+
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Hardware:** HD camera, GPU support for TensorFlow (for real-time performance).
